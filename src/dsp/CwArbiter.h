// Lyra — CW "Auto" arbiter.
//
// Supervises the two RX CW decoders (Classic fldigi + DeepFist neural) when the
// operator selects the "Auto" engine.  It is deliberately engine-agnostic: it
// sees only committed characters tagged by source and a scalar fade confidence
// (DeepFist's keyingRatio), and hands DISPLAY OWNERSHIP to exactly one engine at
// a time.  DeepFist is preferred (cleaner copy); Classic is the fade safety net.
//
// Only the owner's characters are forwarded (onOutput); the muted engine keeps
// running but its output is dropped.  Ownership flips only at a keying GAP (a
// space), so no character is ever cut mid-symbol and there is no de-duplication
// problem by construction.  Asymmetric hysteresis biases toward "never silent":
// fall back fast (nFall), return to DeepFist only when solidly recovered (nRise).
// The FIRST ratio sample after construction or reset() seeds ownership directly
// (solid -> DeepFist, fading -> Classic) so Auto never enters silent mid-fade.
//
// Threading: fed from two threads (Classic on the audio thread, DeepFist on its
// worker thread) — every method takes mx_; onOutput fires OUTSIDE the lock.
// Known benign race: because onOutput fires OUTSIDE the lock, the relative
// order of the two feeder threads' callbacks at an ownership-switch boundary
// is decided by OS scheduling — worst case one transposed character in the
// transcript at a fade switch.  Accepted (2026-07-15): display-only cosmetic;
// do not add hand-over-hand callback locking unless it is ever visible on-air.
