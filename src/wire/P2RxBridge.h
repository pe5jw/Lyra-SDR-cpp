// Lyra — Protocol 2 RX bridge (Saturn / ANAN G2, Phase D).
//
// App-side owner of a P2Session: runs it on its OWN QThread and feeds
// the radio's DDC0 IQ frames into router 0 — the SAME sink the P1 EP6
// path dispatches to (main.cpp registers router_instance(0) port 0 →
// WdspEngine::feedIq at boot).  Everything downstream of that seam —
// WDSP filters / AGC / NR / demod, the panadapter analyzer, S-meter,
// and the audio output — runs UNCHANGED: this bridge is the P2
// equivalent of the EP6 receive thread, nothing more.
//
// This mirrors Thetis's own architecture: its P2 read loop hands DDC
// IQ to the identical xrouter(0, 0, …) call (network.c:608) that
// Lyra's router port is a verbatim port of.
//
// Division of labour with HL2Stream:
//   * HL2Stream REMAINS the tuning/state authority — every VFO
//     gesture, band button, memory recall and CAT command lands in
//     HL2Stream::setRx1FreqHz whether or not the P1 wire is up.  The
//     bridge subscribes to rx1FreqChanged and mirrors the dial onto
//     DDC0, so the entire tuning UI drives the Saturn for free.
//   * The two wire paths are mutually exclusive: open() refuses while
//     the P1 stream runs, and the Settings Open path closes this
//     bridge before opening an HL2.  That guarantee is what makes the
//     single-feeder-thread contract of WdspEngine::feedIq hold.
//
// Sample rate: the DDC follows the engine's IQ rate when it is a
// legal P2 rate (48/96/192/384 kHz — the engine's own choices all
// are); the panadapter span therefore tracks exactly as it does on
// the HL2.  A rate change while running re-sends the DDC config live.
//
// RX-only: P2Session never sets the transmit bit, sends drive 0 and
// PA-disabled (see P2Session.h bench-safety note) — this bridge
// cannot key the Saturn.  TX is later work.
//
// Threading: P2Session (QUdpSocket + timers) lives on thread_; every
// session mutation is marshalled onto that thread via
// QMetaObject::invokeMethod functors.  The IQ decode + xrouter
// dispatch run ON the session thread (direct connection), making it
// the single DSP feeder thread while a P2 radio is open.
