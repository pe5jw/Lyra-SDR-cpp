// Lyra — single-instance guard (header-only; included by src/main.cpp).
//
// Why this exists: Lyra had no single-instance guard, so a second launch
// would happily start a colliding copy — the two fight over the HL2 socket,
// the audio device, and (the operator-visible symptom) the TCI listen port
// 40001, which the first instance already owns → "port in use".  This guard
// makes a second launch RAISE the already-running window and exit, instead
// of starting a second radio.
//
// Forward-compatible with deliberate two-instance operation (two radios, two
// configs — a planned feature): the lock is keyed on an `instanceId`
// (default "default").  Two future config profiles would each carry a
// distinct id, so each gets exactly one instance, while the guard still
// blocks an *accidental* duplicate of the same profile.  A `--new-instance`
// command-line flag bypasses the guard entirely as an explicit escape hatch
// (deliberate second copy for testing) — the ONLY caveat being that today a
// bypassed second copy still shares the default TCI port / radio config, so
// it is a power-user hatch, not the finished two-radio path.
//
// Mechanism (the canonical Qt pattern): a QSharedMemory segment is the
// cross-process lock; a QLocalServer named the same key is the "raise me"
// channel.  On Windows the shared-memory segment is refcounted by the OS and
// released even on a hard crash, so no stale lock survives a crashed primary.
