# RX front-end gain / attenuator — divergence audit vs the reference

Status: **round 2 complete — two independent adversarial verification passes
done. READ THE ROUND-2 SECTION AT THE BOTTOM BEFORE ACTING ON ANY ROW.**
Round 2 overturned one row outright (37), softened two severities (30, 39),
found a third copy of a default the table only had two of (29), and found
six things the table missed — one of which is directly PureSignal-relevant.
It also refuted the headline conclusion that was drawn from row 5.

This is an enumeration, not a plan. Nothing here has been fixed. Rows are
facts with file:line on both sides; where a claim could not be established
by reading, it is in the UNVERIFIED list rather than in the table.

Why this exists: over the TX bring-up and Auto-LNA arc, the operator
repeatedly asked "is this the same as the reference?", and each time a
divergence surfaced — a ceiling, a recovery cadence, a branch, a claimed
latch — that had been introduced here and not carried over from anywhere.
Fixing those one at a time as they were noticed guaranteed the next one
would surface during PureSignal, where `tx_step_attn` is the *shared*
actuator and a divergence is a calibration fault rather than a deaf
receiver. So: enumerate the whole surface once, then decide.

## Axis identity (verified on both sides, not inferred)

The reference writes the wire value as `31 - att`; Lyra writes it as
`gain + 12`. Equating the two wire expressions:

```
gain + 12 = 31 - att        =>        att = 19 - gain
```

Both land at the same byte — `networkproto1.c:1102` / `FrameComposer.cpp:582`
as `(x & 0x3F) | 0x40`. The RTL (`hl2_rtl_ad9866.v:134`) with bit 6 set
passes `cmd_data[5:0]` straight to the AD9866 PGA: 0 = −12 dB … 60 = +48 dB
(`hl2_wiki_Protocol.md:137`).

Mixed-axis comparisons — a limit or default written in one axis and used in
the other — are the specific failure class hunted in area 3 below.

## Divergence table

3 = axis / wire mapping · 4 = ATT-on-TX · 5 = invented or missing.

## Where the RTL contradicts an implementation (RTL wins)

**Row 27.** `console.cs:11043` permits att = 32, which reaches the wire as
`0x3F`. `hl2_rtl_ad9866.v:134` (bit 6 set) hands `cmd_data[5:0]` straight to
the PGA, so the reference's maximum-attenuation UI position commands the
*highest* gain code. Lyra cannot reach it.

**Clip-bit meaning.** `hl2_rtl_control.v:465` clears `clip_cnt` on **every**
response, `:478-479` saturates it, `:472` reports `(&clip_cnt)`.
`resp_addr` advances each response (`:466`) so slot 0 is 1-in-4.
`hl2_wiki_Protocol.md:217` confirms the bit position.

*Corrected in round 2 — the unit was wrong and the last sentence was false.*
`clip_cnt` increments once per **`clk_ctrl` cycle** (2.5 MHz,
`hermeslite_core.v:927`) in which the synchronised `rxclip` level is high —
not once per clip. `rxclip` (`hl2_rtl_ad9866.v:232-241`) is a latch set by a
full-scale sample and cleared by `rxclrstatus`, which `control.v:355`
toggles every control clock. So the flag means **≥3 distinct ~400 ns windows
containing at least one full-scale sample, since the last response frame** —
i.e. a single loud peak lasting >1.2 µs sets it. The flag is *easy* to set.

The original last sentence ("Lyra … still treats it as one") was **false and
contradicted row 2**: Lyra latches (`Ep6RecvThread.cpp:963-965`) and does a
consume-and-clear `exchange` (`hl2_stream.cpp:760-762`). The reference's HL2
loop plain-assigns, so it is the *reference* that samples instantaneously.
That false sentence was the load-bearing premise of the "4× cadence explains
the missed back-off" conclusion — see Round 2 finding C.

**Row 39.** `hl2_rtl_ad9866.v:150-152` forces PGA gain to 0 during `cw_on`
when `en_tx_gain` is clear. Neither host sets `0x0e[15]` (C3 bit 7 is always
0: `networkproto1.c:1019` / `FrameComposer.cpp:381` mask `0x1F`), so this
hardware behaviour is live and unmodelled on both sides.

## UNVERIFIED — needs bench or capture

1. Response-frame rate, hence how many slot-0 frames land inside a 400 ms
   window vs the reference's 100 ms. `resp_rqst` generation was not traced
   out of `hl2_rtl_control.v`. **This gates the #5/#6 conclusion.**
2. Actual dB-per-code of the AD9866 PGA. Taken from
   `hl2_wiki_Protocol.md:137`, not measured.
3. Whether `cmd_resp_rqst` slot-stealing (`hl2_rtl_control.v:468-470`)
   measurably starves slot 0 under heavy command traffic.
4. Whether the change-gate + `CmdHighPriority()` in `SetADC1StepAttenData`
   (`netInterface.c:871-878`) has any P1 effect or is P2-only. Lyra's
   `set_rx_step_attn_db` (`FrameComposer.cpp:228-230`) writes
   unconditionally with no command trigger.
5. Real-world consequence of row 30 (ATT-on-TX "off" = +19 dB here vs
   −12 dB on the reference). The sign is proven by reading; the audible and
   PS impact is not.
6. Whether `autoLnaTimer_` is started/stopped anywhere that would
   incidentally gate it around MOX. Only the `open()`/`close()` sites
   (`hl2_stream.cpp:966`, `:1439`) and the tick's `running_` guard
   (`hl2_stream.cpp:740`) were read.

# Round 2 — independent adversarial verification

Two senior agents, each told to try to break the table rather than confirm
it, each required to open both cited sites per row. Rows 1-24 + the clip-bit
paragraph to one; rows 25-48 + the axis identity to the other.

## Rows overturned or re-graded

**Row 37 — WRONG. Withdraw it.** The reference **does** write the ATT-on-TX
forcing per key. `chkMOX_CheckedChanged2` keydown `console.cs:30293-30327`:
with `m_bATTonTX` true it computes `getTXstepAttenuatorForBand(_tx_band)`
(`:30308`), applies a CW/PS force (`:30309-30312`), then assigns
`SetupForm.ATTOnTX` (`:30314`) → `SetTxAttenData(31 - x)`; with it false it
calls `SetTxAttenData(0)` directly (`:30325`). Keyup `:30388-30414` is
symmetric. That is the *same shape* as our `hl2_stream.cpp:3006`/`:3247`.
The row cited only the property setter and missed the MOX handler entirely.
Not "Different mechanism / MAJOR" — broadly the same mechanism.

**Row 30 — CONFIRMED end-to-end and stronger (three reference sites, not
one: `:19173`, `:10670`, and both MOX edges `:30325`/`:30411`), but
SEVERITY ARGUED DOWN to MAJOR.** `SetTxAttenData` stores raw
(`netInterface.c:1028-1040`) → C4 `0x40` → PGA code 0 = −12 dB; ours applies
`31-0=31` → C4 `0x5F` → code 31 = +19 dB. A 31 dB swing on the PS actuator,
real. **But our defaults mask it completely**: `kDefaultAttOnTxEnabled=true`
+ `kAttOnTxDb=31` → `31-31=0` → C4 `0x40` — **byte-identical to the
reference**. The divergence is only reachable when the operator unticks the
box whose only purpose is protection, and the RTL moots it entirely in CW
(`hl2_rtl_ad9866.v:150-152` forces PGA 0 during `cw_on`). Still fix before
PureSignal; not a live fault at defaults.

**Row 39 — severity DOWN to MINOR.** `cw_on` is the gateware keyer's *active*
state (`hl2_rtl_radio.v:1053`/`:1073`), not a config bit, so the RTL forces
PGA code 0 on every CW key-down on **both** hosts regardless of any host
value. The reference's QSK force-to-31 is redundant on this hardware.

**Row 29 — fact CONFIRMED, attribution WITHDRAWN, and a third site found.**
Reference default → +19 dB, ours → +31 dB: real, ships 12 dB hotter. But the
claim that our `31` *is* the reference's wire-domain constant is a provenance
hypothesis, not readable fact — `hl2_stream.h:739` documents an independent
origin ("old Lyra software-capped at +31 on an 'above this is IMD' call").
Report the divergence, drop the causal story. **Third copy of the literal:
`hl2_stream.h:1778` `std::atomic<int> lnaGainDb_{31}`**, alongside
`hl2_stream.cpp:297` and `:704` — change one and the others silently
disagree.

**Row 27 — over-claim softened.** att=32 → `(-1 & 0x3F)|0x40` = `0x7F` → PGA
code **63**. The wiki defines the range as 0…60 (`hl2_wiki_Protocol.md:137`);
codes 61-63 are undocumented. "Commands maximum gain" is directionally right;
any specific dB figure is not establishable from these trees.

**Row 46 — INCOMPLETE.** The reference's RX2 auto-att block is gated on
`radioHasRx2Att` (`console.cs:21781-21784`), which does **not** list
HERMESLITE. Dead on HL2 *in the reference too* — grade it like row 8, not
"Lyra has no RX2".

**Rows 6, 12, 22, 35, 44 — INCOMPLETE.** See the additions below.

**Citation drift:** rows 7, 11, 12, 18, 19, 24, 32, 38, 47, 48 sit 1-5 lines
off. Individually harmless; collectively it means the table was assembled
from a scroll position rather than re-read.

## New rows (missed entirely by round 1)

| # | Area | Reference does (file:line) | Lyra does (file:line) | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 49 | 4 · **per-key CW / PS-off force-to-31** | `if ((!chkFWCATUBypass.Checked && _forceATTwhenPSAoff) \|\| CurrentDSPMode == CWL \|\| CWU) txAtt = 31;` on **every** keydown — `console.cs:30309-30312` | Static `attOnTxDb_`, no CW branch, no PS-A gating — `hl2_stream.cpp:3006` | **MAJOR — directly PureSignal-relevant.** This is the "Force ATT on Tx to 31 when PS-A off" behaviour, which the operator's own station export has ticked |
| 50 | 4 · ATT-on-TX off-switch interlock | `if (!value && _auto_attTX_when_not_in_ps) return;` — the operator **cannot** disable ATT-on-TX while the PS auto-attenuator has it engaged — `console.cs:19154` | No interlock; a mid-PS toggle is accepted and applied live — `hl2_stream.cpp:3604-3613`, `:3610` | MAJOR (PS) |
| ~~51~~ | ~~1 · reference lamp/act split~~ | **WITHDRAWN — round 3. THERE IS NO SPLIT.** `:21502` sits *inside* `if (_adc_overloaded[i])` (opened `:21496`, closed `:21503`), so it reduces to `_adc_overloaded[i] && level > 3` — algebraically identical to `:21685`. Round 1 and round 2 both read the line without its braces | Our lamp (`hl2_stream.cpp:792`) implements the reference's red rung **exactly** | NOT A DIVERGENCE |
| 51a | 1 · **missing yellow tier** | Three-rung ladder: silent / **yellow** `sWarning` on `level > 0` (`console.cs:21511-21513`) / **red** on `overloaded && level > 3`. Yellow persists ~5 polls while the counter unwinds | Only the red rung exists — no intermediate "overload seen recently" state | MINOR |
| 51b | 1 · **warning suppressed on our exact config** | `if (Model != HERMESLITE \|\| AutoAttRX1 == false) infoBar.Warning(...)` — on **HL2 with auto-att on, NO overload indication is painted at all**; the preamp label reads `"A-ATT"` instead (`console.cs:21342-21348`, `:21522-21524`) | Red lamp shown unconditionally — `qml/AudioPanel.qml:136-146` | MAJOR — a faithful port **removes** our lamp in the default configuration |
| 51c | 1 · confirmation-window intent | `ReleaseNotes.txt:119`: *"auto rx step attenuation will only happen when there has been at least 400ms of adc overload and it moves from a yellow to red warning"* — 4 cycles × 100 ms = **400 ms cumulative**. The `:21502` comment garbles this into "3 cycles… around 400ms" per-cycle | 4 cycles × 400 ms = **1.6 s** — 4× the documented design window | MAJOR — this is the real cadence divergence, and it now has a **documented target** |
| 52 | 4 · TX-att ADC fan-out | `SetTxAttenData` writes `tx_step_attn` to **all** `MAX_ADC` — `netInterface.c:1034-1037` | `adc[0]` only — `FrameComposer.cpp:221`; `adc[1]/[2]` stay at the create-time 31 forever | MINOR (inert on HL2 — only `adc[0]` is composed) |
| 53 | 4 · RX per-band snapshot on key | Snapshots RX1's per-band step-att on the MOX edge — `console.cs:30313` | No RX-side per-band save/restore across a key cycle | MINOR |
| 54 | 5 · dead class ≠ live path | — | `AttOnTxPolicy`'s keyup hook is a deliberate **no-op** (`tx/AttOnTxPolicy.cpp:81-88`) while the live path **restores** (`hl2_stream.cpp:3247`) — resurrecting the dead class would change behaviour | MINOR (see row 44) |

Additions to existing rows: **row 4** — `hl2_stream.cpp:963-964` carries a
**false comment** asserting Auto-LNA reads `adc_overload` directly; it reads
`adc_overload_seen`. **Row 12** — the reference's trigger is a two-branch OR
with outer gates `_auto_att_rx1 && radioHasRx1Att` (`:21680`) and
`_rx1_step_att_enabled` (`:21690`). **Row 22** — persistence is `!_mox`-gated
(`console.cs:11112`), not unconditional. **Row 35** — `RadioNet.cpp:107` is a
comment; the real init is the in-class default `RadioNet.h:287`.

## UNVERIFIED items — resolved or re-stated

**#1 RESOLVED, and it does NOT gate rows 5/6.** `resp_rqst` is a toggle
(`usopenhpsdr1.v:409`) edge-converted by `sync_pulse` (`hermeslite_core.v:
939-943`) into a one-cycle pulse in the control domain — so **`resp_addr`
does not free-run and the slot model holds.** Rate: ~2526 responses/s at
48 kHz nddc=4 ⇒ **~632 slot-0 frames/s, ~1.58 ms apart** ⇒ ~253 per 400 ms
window, ~63 per 100 ms. Neither host is starved. *Residual:* `sync_pulse.v`
is not present in either tree; one-pulse-per-edge is inferred from usage,
not read.

**#2 STILL UNVERIFIED and load-bearing.** The wiki gives only two endpoints
(code 0 = −12 dB, 60 = +48 dB). **1 dB/code is inferred, not proven**, and
every dB figure in rows 27/29/30/32 and the axis identity depends on it.

**#3 RESOLVED and worse than stated.** `resp_cnt` and `resp_addr` are
phase-locked (`control.v:464`, `:466`, `:467`), so a command response can
only ever displace slots **0 and 2** — the clip bit's slot. Sustained
C0-bit-7 traffic starves it **100%**, not partially. Not currently fired:
our composers never set C0 bit 7.

**#4 SUBSTANTIALLY RESOLVED — it is Protocol-2 machinery.**
`CmdHighPriority()` (`network.c:900`, "port 1027"), `CmdGeneral()` (`:808`,
port 1024), `CmdTx()` (`:1168`, port 1026) are the P2 command sockets, and
the call is gated on `prn->sendHighPriority`. On a P1/HL2 session all C&C
rides the EP2 round-robin, so the setter's only P1-relevant effect is the
field store — our unconditional write is correct for P1.

**#5 partially resolved:** the sign is proven three times over, our
default-ON makes the wire byte identical to the reference, and CW is fully
mooted by the RTL. Remaining scope is SSB/AM/FM/digital with protection
explicitly disabled. Audible/measured impact still needs the bench.

**#6 RESOLVED, and the note's own citations were wrong.** `autoLnaTimer_`
has exactly four sites: `setInterval` `hl2_stream.cpp:209`, `connect`
`:210`, `start()` **`:1259`**, `stop()` **`:1438`** (the note cited `:966`,
a comment, and `:1439`, which is `hwPttTimer_`). **There is no MOX-related
gating anywhere**, which makes row 17 strictly worse, not better.

## Finding C — the headline conclusion drawn from row 5 is REFUTED

The cadence facts hold (reference 100 ms at `console.cs:21921`,
`checkOverloadsAndSync()` every iteration; the 1-in-5 divisor applies to
`checkSeqErrors()` only), but the conclusion drawn from them does not.

Both hosts read the same bit from the same ~632 slot-0 frames/s. The
difference is what happens *between* polls:

- **Reference (HL2 loop):** plain assignment ⇒ a **point sample of 1 frame
  out of ~63** per window. Sees a clip with probability ≈ *p*.
- **Ours:** the latch catches **any** of ~253 frames. Probability
  ≈ 1 − (1−*p*)²⁵³.

Same `>3` hysteresis ⇒ reference needs ≈ *p*⁴; ours needs
≈ (1 − (1−*p*)²⁵³)⁴. For any *p* above ~1% our per-poll term is essentially
1. **Our detector is dramatically MORE sensitive than the reference's — only
4× slower.** The latch (row 41) more than offsets the cadence.

The residual regime where the reference acts and we don't is narrow: a
clipping episode of roughly **0.4-1.6 s**, dense enough that four consecutive
100 ms point samples all land on set frames. That is a real latency
divergence worth closing — it is *not* "a signal that would never trip our
detector."

**Ranked source-provable candidates for gain roaming to the ceiling**, per
the verifier: (1) **row 17** — no MOX gate, so the loop runs during transmit,
TX coupling clips ADC0, and the result lands on the wire at unkey; (2) **row
21** and `bandmemory.cpp:164-166` — both snap gain to a stored value the auto
loop must then re-walk, neither of which the reference does; (3) row 16 is a
*reference-favourable* divergence (it creeps **faster** after band change),
so it cannot explain a stuck ceiling.

# Round 3 — the three "reference-side bugs", investigated (2026-07-22)

Operator asked whether items 1 and 2 existed in earlier releases, and put a
third agent on item 3. All three answers changed the picture.

**Bug 3 — DOES NOT EXIST.** See rows 51 / 51a / 51b / 51c above. Round 1
and round 2 both misread brace scope. The replacement findings (missing
yellow tier, warning suppressed on HL2+auto-att, the documented 400 ms
window) are worth more than the "bug" was.

**Bug 1 — DELIBERATE, and MI0BOT-specific.** MI0BOT release notes,
v2.10.3.8 (11 May 2023): *"Increased receiver Attenuate to full range, 32dB
max attenuation."* `ramdor-Thetis` has **no HERMESLITE branch** in the
step-att setter (`Maximum` is 61 or 31 only), confirming the widening came
with the HL2 fork. Open sliver: "32 dB" most likely means *32 steps (0-31)*,
which would make `Maximum = 32` an off-by-one producing the out-of-range
wire code 63. Needs `console.cs` from a current tag to settle; unreachable
on our axis either way.

**Bug 2 — REAL, STILL LIVE UPSTREAM, and it is a merge gap.** Fetched
`networkproto1.c` from MI0BOT **master** (past 2.10.3.14 and
2.10.3.15-beta1): the generic loop OR-accumulates, `MetisReadThreadMainLoop
_HL2` still plain-assigns. `ramdor-Thetis` has **no HL2 loops at all**
(no `MetisReadThreadMainLoop_HL2`, no `WriteMainLoop_HL2`), so on ramdor HL2
runs the generic loop and **gets the OR-accumulate**.

History: MW0LGE fixed the accumulate in official Thetis 2.10.3.13
(`ReleaseNotes.txt:130` — *"issues handling the highprio network packet
(1025) meant that ADC overloads could be missed. This is now resolved."*);
MI0BOT's separately-authored HL2 loops never received it.

**Consequence for "do as the reference does":** the phrase has two different
answers here. *Official Thetis* and the HL2 branch's own sibling loop
OR-accumulate — which is exactly what our `adc_overload_seen` latch does, so
the latch is **not an invention**, it is the same fix arrived at
independently. Only the MI0BOT HL2 loop point-samples.

### DECISION A — operator-locked 2026-07-22: follow OFFICIAL Thetis

**OR-accumulate. Keep the latch. One code path, no per-rig branch.**

Rationale, in the operator's order:
1. ANAN family support is the direction of travel (Jerry's work) and is the
   larger install base; the ANAN path runs the generic loop = accumulate.
2. Accumulate is the **upstream-maintained** semantics — MW0LGE wrote the
   fix and tags it `[2.10.3.13]MW0LGE`.
3. It is **strictly more informative**: it cannot miss a clip the
   point-sample catches, only the reverse.
4. A per-rig branch would encode a **merge accident** as if it were a
   hardware distinction, and every future reader would go looking for the
   hardware reason. If a genuine per-rig difference ever appears it belongs
   in the capability struct (§6.7), not scattered branches.

**Honest qualification (an earlier overstatement, corrected):** PureSignal
does NOT require accumulate. The operator runs MI0BOT on HL2, so PS-A's TX
branch (`console.cs:21593`) has been reading the *point-sampled* flag on
that bench and works. The case for official is convergence and maintenance,
not a PS defect.

**Recorded deviation:** this is a deliberate, documented divergence from the
HL2 tree the operator actually runs. A/B against installed Thetis on HL2
will show our detector catching clips theirs misses. That is expected and
correct — not a bug to chase.

## Standing rules for anyone working this list

- Cite both sides. A claim with a citation on only one side is a hypothesis.
- Do not infer semantics from a function's name — open it. The claim that
  `getAndResetADC_Overload()` was a latch was made twice without reading it;
  the HL2 read loop plain-assigns (`networkproto1.c:502`) and the fix at
  `:338` was never backported.
- Where the RTL disagrees with either host, the RTL wins.
- The step attenuator is the actuator PureSignal will drive. Divergences on
  that register are calibration faults, not preferences.
