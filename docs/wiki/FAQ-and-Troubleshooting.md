## General

**What hardware does Lyra support?**
Hermes Lite 2 and 2+ over HPSDR Protocol 1, and **BrickSDR2** over Protocol 2.
Hermes Lite 2 / 2+ and BrickSDR2 both have **SUB / RX2** (second DDC on
the same ADC) and **SPLIT** (TX on VFO B, independent of SUB). Colours:
orange **TUNE A** / cyan RX1 vs lime **TUNE B** / green RX2; **◀ RX2** /
**RX2 ▶** when SUB is off-span. N2ADR / filter board follows **RX1** —
cross-band SUB is much weaker. **ANAN-10 / 10E / 100 / 100B / 100D /
200D** and **G2 / G2-1K** have Protocol 2 profiles; TX is dummy-load until
that box is on-air validated. Discovery **Hermes** still defaults to
BrickSDR2 — pick the marketed ANAN model in Settings → Hardware. If an
older ANAN still answers as Protocol 1, flash P2 firmware when the
hardware allows — leftover P1 rows are refused (not an HL2). 7000DLE /
8000 stay locked.

**Is it free? What's the license?**
Yes — GPL v3+ (compatible with the WDSP DSP engine it uses). See
[NOTICE](https://github.com/N8SDR1/Lyra-SDR-cpp/blob/main/NOTICE.md).

**Where's my version number?**
Header → the title/about area, or **Help → About**. Releases and notes are
on the [Releases page](https://github.com/N8SDR1/Lyra-SDR-cpp/releases).

**Does it run on macOS / Linux?**
The codebase is cross‑platform C++/Qt, but the shipped installer is Windows
only today. See
[CROSS_PLATFORM.md](https://github.com/N8SDR1/Lyra-SDR-cpp/blob/main/docs/CROSS_PLATFORM.md).

## Connecting

**Lyra doesn't find my radio.**
- Make sure you pressed **▶ Start**, and the PC + HL2 are on the same LAN.
- You don't need an "Any Subnet" or "Via all NICs" option — Lyra **always**
  scans every adapter (including direct‑connect `169.254.x.x`) with both a
  limited ("any subnet") and subnet‑directed broadcast, for P1 and P2. So a
  no‑show usually means the radio's **reply** can't route back (different
  subnets, no IP assigned yet, or a firewall), not that a broadcast mode is
  off.
- Use **Settings → Hardware → Radio → Add by IP** and type the radio's
  address — this sends a directed probe and works across subnets or where
  broadcast is blocked. On a direct cable with no router, give the radio a
  static IP in the **same subnet** as the PC's NIC so its reply can get home.
- Check the radio is powered and its link LED is up; a direct NIC‑to‑radio
  cable is the most reliable setup.

**Do I need to "Run as administrator"?**
No. The installer adds the firewall rules Lyra needs. If you skipped that or
removed the rules, re‑run the installer. If Lyra **won't even launch** unless
you elevate: close leftover `lyra.exe` in Task Manager (or reboot), then start
normally. Current builds also start if a leftover instance's ping fails
instead of blocking forever. "Run as administrator" is not the intended way
to start Lyra.

**Lyra does nothing after an update (no window).**
From **v0.24.3**, a crash during GPU startup steps down OpenGL → software
and **turns off 4× MSAA** on that path (4× samples + software hung some
Intel UHD PCs). From **v0.24.4**, QML docks load **after** the window is
shown (one panel at a time) so a software/Intel hang at `building docks`
has a chance to finish. From **v0.24.5**, if you already picked **Vulkan /
Direct3D / OpenGL** in Settings, that pin is **kept** — a leftover
incomplete-start latch from an older installer no longer forces software
over a working GPU. Try:
1. Start again — the second/third launch is the recovery ladder (only when
   the backend is still Auto).
2. If it still never appears: `lyra.exe --safe` from a command prompt
   (software graphics, no auto-connect).
3. Then **Settings → Visuals → Graphics backend** — pick Vulkan, OpenGL, or
   Direct3D, Apply, restart. **Leave safe mode** if the banner is up.
   You do **not** need Revo or a registry wipe.

**Settings lists my Brick as Hermes / firmware v0.**
A Brick2 that still reports the Hermes board ID is labelled **Brick** when
Lyra already knows it. Firmware is **v{code/10}.{code%10}** (e.g. code 106
→ **v10.6**), matching deskHPSDR. Dual RX needs current Brick2 FPGA; flashing
does not change the Ethernet MAC.

**It froze / connected to the wrong IP on launch.**
Fixed in current versions: Lyra probes the remembered IP first and
**self‑heals** by re‑scanning if the radio isn't there. Update to the
[latest release](https://github.com/N8SDR1/Lyra-SDR-cpp/releases/latest).

**Switching between two radios doesn't work.**
**Close** the current radio before you **Open** another — only one is live
at a time. The connected one is shown green/bold in the list.

## Audio

**No receive audio.**
- Press **▶ Start**, raise **AF Gain / Volume**, and check the squelch
  isn't holding it closed.
- Confirm the **output path** (Audio panel): **HL2 audio jack** = plug into
  the radio; **PC sound device** = pick the right Windows output + host API.
- On the HL2 jack, some firmware swaps L/R — there's a swap option if one ear
  is silent.

**Pops / clicks / glitches in the audio.**
- Use a **wired** connection (ideally a dedicated NIC straight to the HL2),
  not Wi‑Fi.
- Tick the installer's **network‑throttling** option (or set
  `NetworkThrottlingIndex` accordingly) — it stops Windows starving the
  radio's UDP cadence.
- On the PC sound path, try **WASAPI Exclusive** for lower, steadier
  latency.

**How do I get RX audio into WSJT‑X / FLDigi / a logger?**
Use a **Virtual Audio Cable** (VAC) as the PC output, or **TCI**. See
**[User Guide → Digital modes](User-Guide#digital-modes--getting-rx-audio-to-another-program)**.
**Enable VAC1** starts the engine and RX→PC. Transmit from the cable also
needs **Settings → TX → Mic source = PC Soundcard (VAC1)** (or **Use VAC1
as TX source**) plus a VAC **Input** device. **VAC2** is the same pattern
for RX2 (enable **SUB** so VAC2 has audio). **TCI** as mic source is
exclusive — Lyra will not also arm VAC TX. If **Auto-enable for digital**
is on, switch to **DIGU / DIGL**; USB turns that auto path off.

---

## Transmit

**I key up but there's no/low power.**
- Make sure **TX drive** is above 0 and, if your build requires it,
  **Enable PA** is ticked (Settings → TX → Advanced). With the PA off the
  radio keys (relays click) but makes no power — by design.
- Power reads on the **meter** (set it to **PWR**); the HL2 telemetry banner
  also shows PA current.

**Does the meter show CW transmit?**
Yes (current versions). Sending CW from the console **or** a paddle/key
flips the meter to forward power and reds the VFO on‑air. The panadapter
stays on RX during CW so you still see the keyed carrier.

**No band voltage on IO-board J3 / Xiegu GP100 (M0AWS wiring).**
There are **two analog paths**. **J3** is gateware **Band Volts** on the
fan PWM pin (DeskHPSDR *HL2 Band Volts / Dither Bit*, MI0BOT Thetis
*HL2 Band Volts*). Tick **HL2 Band Volts on J3**, gateware **≥72p5**,
**Stop then Start**. The **N2ADR / IO board** box is OC → Pico PWM, usually
**J4 pin 8**, not J3. M0AWS DB9 BAND often follows the Pico analog, so
enable the N2ADR box and confirm the jumper is the pin your amp actually
reads. From **v0.24.3** a persisted J3 tick is pushed on every Open
(previously it could stay off the wire until you flipped the box).

**I'm running an amplifier — anything to set first?**
Yes — configure **TR‑sequencing** and the **RF‑delay / ATT‑on‑TX**
protections before keying into an amp. Per-band **PA Gain / Full Output (W)**
and the optional **watts cap** live on **Settings → PA Gain** (including a
dedicated **11m** slot). Read
**[User Guide → external amplifier](User-Guide#operating-with-an-external-amplifier-hot-switch-protection)**
and **[Settings → PA Gain](User-Guide#settings--pa-gain)**.

**JTDX won't connect over TCI (but MSHV does).**
Fixed in current versions (the TCI audio handshake now echoes the ack JTDX
expects). Update to the latest release.

## Settings &amp; layout

**How do I rearrange / lock the panels?**
Drag a panel by its title bar — a cyan zone previews where it lands (edge /
split / tab / float). Drag the cyan separators to resize. **View → Layouts**
has four save‑able slots plus the factory default. **View → Lock panels**
(Ctrl+L) freezes move *and* resize. See
**[User Guide → Getting around the window](User-Guide#getting-around-the-window)**.

**Back up or move my settings to another PC.**
Settings export/import writes a single profile file you can copy. See
**[User Guide → Backing up &amp; sharing your settings](User-Guide#backing-up--sharing-your-settings)**.

**First launch is stuck "optimizing".**
That's the one‑time FFT plan‑cache build — let it finish (a few minutes).
It only happens once (or after **Clear &amp; rebuild**).

## Dual receive (SUB / RX2) — HL2 and BrickSDR2

**How do I turn on the second receiver?**
Press **SUB** on the Tuning panel (it lights **green**). There is **no**
“enable RX2” checkbox under **Settings → Network**. TCI clients use
`rx_enable:1` (or the SUB button). Setting an RX2 frequency does **not**
auto-enable SUB.

**SUB vs SPLIT — which is which?**
**SUB** is a second *receiver* (its own frequency, mode, ear). **SPLIT**
moves *transmit* to VFO B. They are independent — both, one, or neither.
FM **RPT** still replaces SPLIT in FM.

**What do the colours mean?**
**Orange TUNE A** + **cyan** passband = RX1. **Lime TUNE B** + **green**
passband / carrier = RX2. Band chips: **red** glow = RX1’s band, **green**
glow = SUB’s band. Lime **TX** line (red while keyed) is **SPLIT**, not
RX2. Full map: **[User Guide → Second receiver](User-Guide#second-receiver-sub--rx2--how-it-works)**.

**What are ◀ RX2 and RX2 ▶?**
Chips on the **left** or **right** edge of the panadapter when SUB is on
but RX2 is **off the current span**. **Click** to swap VFOs so the
waterfall (always RX1 IQ) shows that parked frequency; RX2 keeps the band
you left. **◀ TX** / **TX ▶** are the same idea for SPLIT TX — don’t mix
them up.

**How do I hop SUB to another band without moving VFO A?**
**Shift+click** or **right-click** a Ham / BC / 11m chip. Plain **click**
stays the focused VFO (usually A). GEN / TIME / Mem stay RX1-only.

**Can TCI / SDRLogger+ drive RX2?**
Yes. `vfo:1,0` / `dds:1` = SUB frequency; `vfo:0,1` = SPLIT VFO B (does
**not** turn SUB on). Calibrated S-meter: `rx_channel_sensors` **0,0** =
RX1, **1,0** = RX2 (quiet floor ~−140 dBm if SUB is off). Combo auto-RST
still uses **RX1** only — see **[SDRLogger+ Combo](SDRLogger-Plus-Combo)**.

**Hermes Lite 2 second receiver?**
Same **SUB** button as BrickSDR2 (Protocol 1 DDC1). One ADC + N2ADR
filter follows RX1 — same-band SUB is full strength; another ham band
on RX2 is much weaker. Status log warns once when the amateur bands
differ.
