# Lyra — Hermes Lite 2 / 2+ SDR Transceiver

**A native C++23 / Qt 6 SDR transceiver for the Hermes Lite 2 / 2+ — full receive *and* transmit, a GPU-accelerated panadapter, and a studio-grade TX audio rack. No Python, no GIL, nothing in the signal path but native code.**

## What Lyra is

A modern, native replacement for a classic HPSDR console — built from the
ground up in C++23 with a GPU-rendered spectrum and a full transmit chain that
would normally mean wiring an outboard studio rack in front of the radio.
Everything runs on the desktop, on the GPU where it helps, and over a plain
wired Ethernet link to the radio.

## Radio support at a glance

| Radio | Status |
|---|---|
| **Hermes Lite 2** | ✅ Supported |
| **Hermes Lite 2+ (AK4951)** | ✅ Supported |
| ANAN family (HPSDR Protocol 2) | 🗺️ Planned |
| Other HPSDR Protocol-1 boards | 🗺️ Planned *(needs a tester with the hardware)* |

Full detail on the **[Supported Radios](Supported-Radios)** page.

## Operating system

| OS | Status |
|---|---|
| **Windows 10 (64-bit, v1809+) / Windows 11** | ✅ Supported today |
| **Linux** | 🗺️ On the roadmap — a future version |
| **macOS** | 🗺️ On the roadmap — a future version |

## At a glance — what works now

✅ Full **receive** (all modes, the complete WDSP noise/filter toolkit, RX EQ,
captured-noise reduction, CTUN, RIT) · ✅ Full **transmit** — SSB / AM / SAM /
DSB / FM / CW plus digital over TCI & VAC · ✅ a **native TX audio rack**
(8-band EQ, multiband Combinator, plate reverb, speech processing, voice
keyer, VOX, TX profiles) · ✅ **CW** send + on-screen **CW decode** · ✅
**DX spots**, **frequency calibration**, **tuner memory**, **CAT / TCI /
VAC**, a **session recorder**, backup & restore, and a **dockable** Vulkan UI.

See the full checklist on **[Feature Status](Feature-Status)**.

## A studio rack, inside the radio

Lyra ships the kind of transmit audio chain you'd normally wire up as outboard
gear — all native, all in front of the WDSP transmitter:

| 8-band parametric EQ | 5-band Combinator | Speech processing |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| [![TX EQ](https://n8sdr1.github.io/Lyra-SDR-cpp/feat-eq.jpg)](https://n8sdr1.github.io/Lyra-SDR-cpp/) | [![TX Combinator](https://n8sdr1.github.io/Lyra-SDR-cpp/feat-combinator.jpg)](https://n8sdr1.github.io/Lyra-SDR-cpp/) | [![TX Speech rack](https://n8sdr1.github.io/Lyra-SDR-cpp/feat-speech.jpg)](https://n8sdr1.github.io/Lyra-SDR-cpp/) |
| Draggable response curve over a live analyzer | Multiband compression, X-Air-style | Noise gate, auto-AGC, de-esser, DX cut-through |

<sub>Screens from the [feature tour](https://n8sdr1.github.io/Lyra-SDR-cpp/). Plus plate reverb, voice keyer, VOX, and save/recall TX profiles — see **[Feature Status](Feature-Status)**.</sub>

## On the roadmap

🗺️ **RX2** dual receiver · 🗺️ **PureSignal** adaptive predistortion · 🗺️
**HPSDR Protocol 2 + ANAN** · 🗺️ **Linux, then macOS** · plus a 2-tone test
generator and a second virtual-audio channel (VAC2).

Details, ordering, and status on the **[Roadmap](Roadmap)**.

## Companion app — SDRLogger+

**[SDRLogger+](https://n8sdr1.github.io/SDRLoggerPlus/)** is Lyra's sister
application — a modern contest/DX logger by the same developer. Connect it to
Lyra over TCI and flip on the **[Combo link](SDRLogger-Plus-Combo)** and the two
work as one: copy a call once in Lyra's CW console and it lands in the log with a
callbook lookup, the operator's name comes back to your `{NAME}` macro, RST-Rcvd
auto-fills from Lyra's calibrated S-meter, and a `{LOG}` macro logs the QSO as you
send 73. → **[Get SDRLogger+](https://n8sdr1.github.io/SDRLoggerPlus/)**
